# Loan Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to develop a predictive model for determining the approval status of loans. The model will utilize machine learning techniques
to analyze various features and make accurate predictions regarding whether a loan application should be approved or not.
- The machine learning algorithms used in this project are -
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Naive Bayes
   - Random Forest
   - K-Nearest neighbors
   - Linear Discriminant Analysis
   - Support Vector Machine
 
 ## Dataset

- The dataset used for this project is collected from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset
- The dataset consists of two .csv files that are : 
   - Training Data - It is labeled data of 614 rows i.e, consists of features as well as targets.
   - Testing Data - It consists of only features on which predictions need to be generated.
